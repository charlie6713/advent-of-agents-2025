## Day 2

Today I learned that YAML is used to define agent behavior through configuration rather than code.

I installed uv / uvx as the toolchain.
I created a local AI agent using `adk create --type=config`.
I selected the `gemini-2.5-flash` model for the agent.
I started the local Web UI using `adk web`.
I explored and understood the role of `root_agent.yaml` in defining the agent's identity and instructions.
