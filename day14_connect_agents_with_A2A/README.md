## day 14

I learned how the A2A protocol lets agents communicate across services.
I created a production-ready A2A agent using:
uvx agent-starter-pack create -p -a adk_a2a_base
I exposed my agent with A2AServer and connected to other agents using RemoteA2aAgent.
I built and connected agents as microservices using ADK
